(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard (mumble_grumble) 

    Consider the following two inductively defined types. *)

Module MumbleGrumble.

Inductive mumble : Type :=
  | a
  | b (x : mumble) (y : nat)
  | c.

Inductive grumble (X:Type) : Type :=
  | d (m : mumble)
  | e (x : X).

(** Which of the following are well-typed elements of [grumble X] for
    some type [X]?  (Add YES or NO to each line.)
      - [d (b a 5)]                   No: d's argument does not have type.
      - [d mumble (b a 5)]            YES
      - [d bool (b a 5)]              YES
      - [e bool true]                 YES
      - [e mumble (b c 0)]            YES
      - [e bool (b c 0)]              No: (b c 0) is not a bool.
      - [c]                           No: It's a mumble.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, optional (poly_exercises) 

    Here are a few simple exercises, just like ones in the [Lists]
    chapter, for practice with polymorphism.  Complete the proofs below. *)

Inductive prod (X Y : Type) : Type :=
| pair (x : X) (y : Y).
Arguments pair {X} {Y} _ _.

Notation "( x , y )" := (pair x y).
Notation "X * Y" := (prod X Y) : type_scope.

Definition fst {X Y : Type} (p : X * Y) : X :=
  match p with
  | (x, y) => x
  end.

Definition snd {X Y : Type} (p : X * Y) : Y :=
  match p with
  | (x, y) => y
  end.

Fixpoint combine {X Y : Type} (lx : list X) (ly : list Y)
           : list (X*Y) :=
  match lx, ly with
  | [], _ => []
  | _, [] => []

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard, optional (combine_checks) 

    Try answering the following questions on paper and
    checking your answers in Coq:
    - What is the type of [combine] (i.e., what does [Check
      @combine] print?)
    - What does

        Compute (combine [1;2] [false;false;true;true]).

      print?
*)

(* Just try them :) *)


(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, recommended (split) 

    The function [split] is the right inverse of [combine]: it takes a
    list of pairs and returns a pair of lists.  In many functional
    languages, it is called [unzip].

    Fill in the definition of [split] below.  Make sure it passes the
    given unit test. *)

Fixpoint split {X Y : Type} (l : list (X*Y))
               : (list X) * (list Y) := 
  match l with
  | [] => ([], [])
  | (x, y) :: t => match split t with
                   | (x1, y1) =>  (x :: x1, y :: y1)
                   end
  end.

Example test_split:
  split [(1,false);(2,false)] = ([1;2],[false;false]).
Proof.
  reflexivity.
Qed.
